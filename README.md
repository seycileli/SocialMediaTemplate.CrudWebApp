# SocialMediaTemplate.CrudWebApp

This is a backend code of a typical Social Media website.

<hr>

The User can login/ register, create a User Profile, Follow users, and post a Message that will have a user Feed with followers messages.

With this template, you can connect to a database as well, and we are using EcipseLink JPA's (annotations)

The first version is created by using HttpServlet, which is an old method/ version

The next version will be an improvement from that version and we will be implementing Spring MVC (Model and View Controller) method.
