# SocialMediaTemplate.CrudWebApp

This is a basic Social Media website, where a User can login/ register, create a User Profile, Follow users, and post a Message that will have a user Feed with followers messages.

The first version is created by using HttpServlet, which is an old method.

The next version will be an improvement from that version and we will be implementing Spring MVC (Model and View Controller) method.
